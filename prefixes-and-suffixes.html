<h1>Gutterals</h1>
<p>
	There are four Hebrew letters that are called the <dfn>gutterals</dfn>. <span class="big">ר</span> sometimes behaves like a gutteral, althought strictly speaking it isn't a gutteral.

<h1>The Definite Article, The</h1>
<h2>Hebrew</h2>
<p>
	To take any word, say like, <span class="big">מֶלֶךְ</span> (<i>melekh</i>, "king") and turn it into the definite form ("the king") we attach a prefix onto the beginning of the word. This differs from English where "the" is written as a separate word. The rule basically has two parts, with some exceptional cases that are recorded in <a href="#fig-hebrew-definite-article" class="xref"></a>.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Add the letter <span class="big">ה</span> to beginning of the word, usually with a patach, <span class="big">הַ</span>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add a doubling dagesh to what was originally the first letter of the word, unless that letter is a gutteral.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Hence, for <span class="big">מֶלֶךְ</span>, <i>melekh</i>, we derive the word <span class="big">הַמֶּלֶךְ</span>, <i>hammelekh</i>.
</p>
<p>
	If the first letter originally had a hardening dagesh then the same dot changes its meaning to become a doubling dagesh instead of a hardening one and the pronunciation of the consonant changes. Thus, <span class="big">בַּת</span> (<i>bat</i>, "daughter") becomes <span class="big">הַבַּת</span> (<i>havvat</i>). A dagesh after a vowel is always a doubling dagesh.
