<h1>The ElizaLang Language</h1>
<p>
	I made up&nbsp;/ am making up my own language!
</p>

<p>
	This article doesn't deal with vocabulary. All words given are either English words or else nonsensical terms like <i>1es</i>, both of which are used as placeholders for the real ElizaLang words. This article also doesn't deal with the ElizaLang alphabet, punctuation marks or the shapes of the diacritical marks. Presently the letters are identified by their transcriptions into English only. The ElizaLang alphabet is a full alphabet though! That is, the vowels are given their own letters, rather than being diacritic marks like the short vowels in Arabic. There is no notion of capital and lower case letters though.

	<summary><h1>Sentence Structure</summary>

	<h2>Word Order</h2>
	ElizaLang is a consistently head-first language.
	<ul>
		<li>Verb–Subject–Object (VSO)</li>
		<li>Possessed–Possessor (NG)</li>
		<li>Noun–Adjective (NA)</li>
		<li>Noun-Quantifier</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Markers</h2>
	<p>
		Adverbs and adjectives are consistently marked with an identical suffix to indicate their status as modifiers to a verb and to a noun respectively.
	</p>

	<h2>Omitting the Subject (Null-Subject &amp; Topicization)</h2>
	<p>
		The subject of a sentence can be omitted, in which case the subject is last subject or object noun phrase that included a special word in some previous sentence. Let's call that special word "topic".  The topic defaults to the subject of the first sentence if no topic has been explicitly introduced yet, and defaults to the first person exclusive singular if the subject is omitted from the first sentence.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"ran" &rarr; I ran.</li>
		<li>"ran you" &rarr; You ran.</li>
		<li>"ran you. jumped." &rarr; You ran. You jumped.</li>
		<li>"walked. ran you. jumped." &rarr; I walked. You ran. I jumped.</li>
		<li>"walked. ran you topic. jumped." &rarr; I walked. You ran. You jumped.</li>
		<li>"walked. ran you topic. jumped I. fell. hurt" &rarr; I walked. You ran. I jumped. You fell. You hurt.</li>
	</ul>

	<summary><h1>Gender</h1></summary>
	<p>
		In ElizaLang nouns are not declined by gender and verbs are not conjugated by gender. Objects don't have genders and people shouldn't be judged by their genders!
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h1>Number &amp; Definiteness</h1></summary>
	<p>
		Nouns come before quantifiers. If no quantifier is given then the quantifiers "one" or "some" are assumed. Nouns are declined by definiteness and by number (singular or plural) and noun declensions must agree with any quantifier given. For example, "cat<span class="long">u</span>na two" would mean "two cats" if the word "cat" meant what does in English but, "cat two", is invalid (just as, "two cat", is in English).

	<p>
		The unknown number can also be used in the first person when the number is in fact known but the author wishes to leave it unspecified because the number of people may change over time, such as if additional people join a team to start writing in ElizaLang, <em>c.f. the Royal "We"</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike English, pronouns in ElizaLang will remain the same in both the subject and the object positions, rather than creating constructions like, "He played him". In ElizaLang this would take the form, "Played 3as 3as." There will however be a morpheme similar to the English <i>-self</i> or <i>-selves</i> in order to create reflexive pronouns.

	<summary><h1>Counting</h1></summary>
	<p>
		The counting system is base twelve and positional. There are distinct words and numerical digits for the numbers zero to eleven. As usual the actual words haven't been decided yet. There are also special words for numbers of the form 12<sup><var>n</var></sup> for <var>n</var>&nbsp;&isin; 3..11. These are formed by inflecting the word for <var>n</var> in some way. For now let's use the suffix <i>ni</i>, though the actual suffix hasn't been decided yet. So, threeni represents 12<sup>3</sup>, fourni represents 12<sup>4</sup>, and so on.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			To represent an integer between zero and eleven use the dedicated word for that number.
		</li>
		<li>
			To represent an integer between 12<sub>10</sub> and 1727<sub>10</sub> (=12<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;- 1), or equivalently between 10<sub>12</sub> and BBB<sub>12</sub>: take each numerical digit separately in order of most significant to least significant and output the dedicated word for the number corresponding to each digit.
		</li>
		<li>
			To represent an integer <var>x</var> larger than BBB<sub>12</sub>:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Truncate <var>x</var> to three significant figures (in base twelve) to obtain <var>x&prime;</var>.
					</p>
					<aside>
						Technically this step is optional, but in ElizaLang it's highly, highly unusual to read aloud or write out long strings of numbers like we have in English, for example, seven hundred and sixty-eight thousand five hundred and thirty-nine.  It's unusual to the point of being insulting. Although in English we seldom write out long sequences of words like this we do use them in speech.
					</aside>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Identify the maximum possible integer <var>n</var>&nbsp;&isin; 3..11 and integers <var>m</var>&nbsp;&isin; 1..11 and <var>r</var>&nbsp;&isin; 0..12<sup>n</sup>-1 such that <var>x&prime;</var>&nbsp;= <var>m</var>&nbsp;&times; 12<sup><var>n</var></sup>&nbsp;+ <var>r</var>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If <var>m</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 then you have the option of going back and deriving a new <var>x&prime;</var> with four significant figures if you wish.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					If <var>m</var>&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;1 then output the word for <var>m</var>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Output the inflected word for <var>n</var>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If <var>r</var>&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Taking each numerical digit of <var>r</var> separately,
						</li>
						<li>
							drop any zero digits in the least significant positions so that the resulting list of digits doesn't end in a 0, and,
						</li>
						<li>
							output a word for each remaining digit in order of most significant to least significant by outputting the dedicated word for the number corresponding to that digit.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		A possible extension to the system (though perhaps unnecessary) is to use <i>zeroni</i> to represent 12<sup>12</sup>, <i>oneni</i> to represent 12<sup>13</sup> and <i>twoni</i> to represent 12<sup>14</sup> (in base 12, 10<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>11</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Essentially the system for expressing large numbers works somewhat like scientific notation in mathematics, where a number like 1728 would be written as 1.728&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>. In ElizaLang the <i>-ni</i> word acts as both the equivalent of the decimal point and the equivalent of the &times;10<sup>3</sup> part, although everything is in base twelve in ElizaLang. The convention of dropping of the word for "one" where it would otherwise occur before a <i>-ni</i> word is inspired by computerized representations of numbers (IEEE&nbsp;754).
