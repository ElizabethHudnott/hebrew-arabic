Tonic (T), Pretonic (PT), Propretonic (PPT)

PPT (afterwards):
	Kamatz or tsere -> shvā

PT (afterwards):
	-> shvā

Segolate nouns
	X + segol and stress on 1st syllable -> shvā + kamatz
	(X = segol, tsere, holam)
	(PS a -> e, i -> ē, u -> ō)

	patach + P(patach) -> shvā + kamatz
	X + patach + P -> shvā + kamatz

	(P = ayin or chet, i.e. pharyngeal)


gutterals can't take a shvā so have a hataf vowel (compound shvā) instead.

monosyllabic nouns
	short vowel -> dagesh in plural

preposition min (from, some)
	מִן־ or מִ + dagesh
	gutturals: no dagesh, tsere instead is hiriq
	not merged with הָ
