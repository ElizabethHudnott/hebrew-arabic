	<h1>Casual Studies in Linguistics: The Semitic Languages</h1>
	<p>I created this page as a way of recording my own individual learning. The disclaimer is that it's written by a novice, not an expert. I found that there's a lot of information out there but it's not very visual, and it can be difficult to see the wood from the trees. I'm particularly interested in three things: commonalities (and of course differences too) between the Semitic languages, commonalities between the Indo-European languages, and the historical development of alphabets.</p>

	<p>The Semitic languages include: Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, Classical Arabic (the language of the Qur'an), Sabaean, Modern Israeli Hebrew, Modern Standard Arabic, Ge'ez and Amharic (two Ethiopian languages) and Maltese.</p>

		<figcaption>The 29 Proto-Semitic Consonants.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<div class="info">
		<div>
			<p>The Semitic languages as a whole have 29 original <em>consonant</em> sounds. Actually, there are far more sounds than that. Every language, every dialect and every time period has evolved its own collection of sounds. But each sound can be placed into one of 29 categories. Shown above are some English letters that'll serve as labels for the 29 consonants. For now, don't worry about what they sound like. <span class="hebrew">c</span><span class="thick">h</span> certainly isn't pronounced anything like the "Ch" sound in "Church", for example. Linguists think there was an original Proto-Semitic language (or at least a common melting pot) which then split off into many separate languages.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Here are the Arabic letters. The Arabic alphabet wasn't developed until quite late, the 3rd&nbsp;Century&nbsp;CE, but it distinguishes 28 out the 29 sounds with separate letters, so it's useful to have the Arabic alphabet in mind at all times. Actually, hamza (<span class="big">ء</span>) isn't considered an independent letter, but nonetheless it is a symbol that adds the ʼ sound onto other letters such as <span class="big">و</span> and <span class="big">ي</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>And here is the Hebrew alphabet, which only contains 22 letters. However, even when the alphabet was first used the Hebrew language already included 25 different consonant sounds, <span class="big">ח</span> standing for both <span class="hebrew">c</span><span class="thick">h</span>  and kh, and <span class="big">ש</span> standing for both s<span class="hebrew">h</span> and s<span class="arabic">h</span>. Following a line up or down a column can help us find <dfn>cognates</dfn>, instances where an Arabic word and a Hebrew word share the same historical origins. Sometimes the meanings of cognate words diverge over time and they come to mean very different things, and sometimes they still mean roughly the same thing (although sometimes with subtle culturally specific connotations added). Of course the Hebrew language and the Hebrew alphabet exhibit incredibly rich history, literature and discourse, and the purpose is not to attempt to reduce Hebrew to a fictional subcategory of Arabic, merely to provide learning aids for people interested in learning both.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>There are some Hebrew letters whose boxes span more than one column. </p>

	<h1>Pronunciation</h1>
	<p>The equivalent English pronunciations given are not exact but are probably good enough to get you started. For example, a skilled Arabic speaker will pronounce the letter <span class="big">ث</span> ("th") with the tongue protruding in front of the teeth and between the lips, whereas an English speaker will place the tongue behind the teeth.</p>

				<li>
					The <i>j</i> sound is the Standard Arabic pronunciation that's used for Qur'an recitation. In parts of Northern Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and Oman a <i>g</i> or <i>gy</i> (<i>gyuh</i>) pronunciation is spoken. In the Levant and parts of North Africa a hard <i>z</i> sound is used (as in <span class="emchar">g</span>enre). The Hebrew <span class="big">גּ</span> is mostly pronounced as <i>g</i>, an exception being some Yemenite Jewish groups where it's pronounced as <i>j</i>. According to some sources <span class="big">ج</span> was originally pronounced closer to <i>g</i> in Muhammad's time (peace be upon him). Whenever I use <i>g</i> in transcriptions I am referring to the hard g sound such as in <i>get</i>, rather than the soft g such as in <i>gem</i>, which is transcribed as <i>j</i>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <i>h</i> is <dfn>voiceless</dfn>, without the vocal chords vibrating, as in <span class="emchar">h</span>ot, rather than being voiced, as in be<span class="emchar">h</span>ind.
				</li>
				<li>
					When a noun is in a grammatical form called the <em>construct state</em> (which is indicated by a diacritical mark called a <em>tanwin</em>) then <span class="big">ة</span> is pronounced as <i>t</i>, otherwise it's pronounced as <i>h</i>. It's also pronounced as <i>h</i> if you pause for breath or stop speaking after it. Hebrew also has the concept of construct state but a word in the construct state has its final letter <span class="big">ה</span> changed to a <span class="big">ת</span>, whereas in Arabic the letter remains as <span class="big">ه</span> but has the two dots added to it, becoming <span class="big">ة</span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <i>w</i> sound is used in Arabic and in Hebrew spoken by Yemenite and Iraqi Jews. Other Hebrew dialects use a <i>v</i> sound instead.
				</li>
				<li>
					There are a variety of different ways of producing an <i>r</i> sound and any of them are accepted. The most ancient form is probably a rolled <i>r</i>. Another quite old one is with the tongue touching the palate. In Arabic it is necessary to have two distinct pronunciations for <span class="big">ر</span>, one heavy and one light, see <a href="#ss-heavy-letters" class="xref"></a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Where an Arabic word and a Hebrew word share a common origin the <i>s</i> and <i>sh</i> sounds are often swapped, for example <i>sheme<strong>sh</strong></i>, <span class="big">שֶׁמֶשׁ</span>, and <i>sham<strong>s</strong></i>, <span class="big">شَمْس</span>. This table shows letters aligned according to pronunciation whereas <a href="#fig-cognates" class="xref"></a> shows their historical alignment.
				</li>
				<li>
					In early Biblical times <span class="big">שׂ</span> was originally pronounced differently from <span class="big">ס</span> (probably like the <i>ll</i> sound in Welsh). But by the time Ezra–Nehemiah was written there is evidence it had already come represent the same sound as <span class="big">ס</span>. It's not normal practice to attempt to reproduce a distinction today. (Except in writing!)

				<figcaption>Unusual sounds for English speakers.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<div class="footnotes">
				<p>
					The letter <span class="big">خ</span> has two permissible pronunciations that are similar but distinct. I've used the <dfn>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</dfn> to differentiate them. The IPA is a collection of symbols which can represent the sounds of any language. The [χ] pronunciation is made by lifting the back of the tongue and breathing as if you're trying to remove phlegm. The [x] sound is like the pronunciation of <span class="big">غ</span> (to be discussed in <a href="#ss-heavy-letters" class="xref"></a>) except that it's unvoiced. You can learn about voiced and unvoiced sounds by placing your fingers on your voice box and pronouncing the letters <i>s</i> and <i>z</i>. The <i>z</i> sound is voiced and you should be able to feel your vocal chords vibrate, whereas <i>s</i> is an unvoiced sound, without vibration.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Classical pronunciation of <span class="big">خ</span> is as [χ], though the [x] pronunciation might be even older. From the Septuagint, scholars have determined that some words containing <span class="big">ח</span> were at that time pronounced as [χ] but others were pronounced as [ħ] (<a href="#ss-heavy-letters" class="xref"></a>). This distinction was forgotten and present day Hebrew speakers consistently use one of [ħ], [χ] or [x] for all words (it varies between different Jewish traditions). The <span class="big">כ</span> may be heard spoken as either [x] or [χ] (traditionally [x]).
				</p>
				<p>
					The Septuagint is a Greek translation of the Bible, translated in stages between the 3rd Century BCE and 132BCE for the library of Alexandria in Egypt, a place where there was a strong Jewish community at the time. The hypothesis about the different pronunciations of <span class="big">ח</span> was made by looking at which Greek letters were chosen to represent the sounds of the names of people and places.
				</p>

			<h2>Begadkefat (Hard and Soft Letters)</h2>
			<p>
				In Hebrew there are six letters which can have two pronunciations each. The correct pronunciation is indicated by the presence or absence of a <dfn>hardening dagesh</dfn> (dot). The dagesh is part of the pronunciation rules of the language. For example, if a word which usually begins with a letter with a hardening dagesh comes after a word that ends in a vowel then it loses its hard sound and adopts the soft pronunciation. Usually a letter has a hardening dagesh when it doesn't have a vowel before it or when it's doubled. The usual practice is to distinguish at least three hard and soft pairs. The other three pairs are less commonly distinguished, some speakers pronouncing the soft versions as though they were the hard ones. However, even the <span class="big">ב/בּ</span>&nbsp;(<i>b/v</i>) distinction is not fully universally distinguished (and in some dialects the <span class="big">ב</span> may be an intermediate sound, [β] in IPA).
			</p>
			<p>
				On the Arabic side of things, there are ten fully independent letters in this section. The sounds will still have hard or soft qualities but understanding those features is not required to understand Arabic. There is, for example, no special relationship between <span class="big">ك</span> and <span class="big">خ</span>. The pairs <span class="big">د</span> and <span class="big">ذ</span> and <span class="big">ت</span> and <span class="big">ث</span> do look visually similar however. This is because both Hebrew and Arabic use adaptations of two alphabets which were originally both used to write the Aramaic language, which, like Hebrew, has the soft-hard distinction.

			<h2 id="ss-heavy-letters">Heavy and Light Letters</h2>
			<p>
				Some sounds can be modified to create both heavy and light versions. There are seven pairs of heavy and light letters and two additional Arabic letters that are sometimes heavy and othertimes light without changing the letter's appearance.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are three different methods which can be used to make a letter heavy. It helps to make the right sound if you visualize where it's coming from. To some extent the three techniques are interchangeable, as the main objective is to create some contrast between the heavy and the light letters. Nonetheless in the interests of  precision the "proper" techniques are listed in <a href="#fig-heavy-light" class="xref"></a>. A secondary aspect to making a good heavy or light pronunciation is to make the lips spread wide (like a smile) for the light letters and rounded (like a <i>w</i>) for the heavy letters.
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Velarization</dt>
				<dd>Uses the top part of the back of the mouth. Both English and Arabic have <i>l</i> with and without velarization. If you say the words <i>lips</i> and <i>full</i> then you may notice two different sounds and different feelings in the mouth. However, some heavy accents outside of England only have the heavy <i>l</i>, and some speakers use a different technique involving the teeth to produce it.  The sounds for <i>g</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>ng</i> also come from the velar region of the mouth.</dd>
				<dt>Pharyngealization</dt>
				<dd>Performed by tensing up the lower part of the back of the mouth.</dd>
				<dt>Glottalization</dt>
				<dd>Performed by pinching in a muscle located inside the voice box, in the neck.</dd>

				<figcaption>Heavy and light letter pairs.</figcaption>

				<li>
					<span class="big">ח/ح/</span>[ħ] is also an unvoiced version of <span class="big">ע/ع</span>. See also, <a href="#ss-non-english" class="xref"></a> for alternative pronunciations and transcriptions of <span class="big">ח</span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="big">צ</span> is alternatively pronounced as a <i>t</i> rapidly followed by and blended together with an <i>s</i> (both light) in some Hebrew dialects, a method of articulation called an <dfn>affricate consonant</dfn>. The same <i>ts</i> sound occurs in English words ending in <i>ts</i>, such as <i>ca<span class="emchar">ts</span></i> and in the word <i>pi<span class="emchar">zz</span>a</i>. Some experts think the original Proto-Semitic sound was <em>both</em> heavy and affricate. English words frequently make use of two more affricate consonants: <i>ch</i> is a combination of <i>t</i> and <i>sh</i>; and <i>j</i> is a combination of <i>d</i> and a hard <i>z</i> (as in <i><span class="emchar">g</span>enre</i>, <i>vi<span class="emchar">s</span>ion</i>, <i>equa<span class="emchar">t</span>ion</i> and <i>sei<span class="emchar">z</span>ure</i>).
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="big">ظ</span> is a heavy version of <span class="big">ذ</span>, the <i>th</i> sound in <i><span class="emchar">th</span>e</i>. It is not supposed to be a heavy version of <span class="big">ز</span> (<i>z</i>) in <em>Standard Arabic</em> (though it can be this way in Levantine Arabic) even though the most common English alphabet transcription of <span class="big">ظ</span> is as <span class="thick arabic-only">z</span>. The transcription is misleading so far as standard Arabic is concerned.
				</li>
				<li>
					Speakers of some dialects pronounce one or both of these as light sounds, similar to or exactly the same as the corresponding light letters.	
				</li>
				<li>
					Uvular is similar to pharyngealized.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pronounced as <i>g</i> in some dialects (same as <span class="big">גּ</span>), which is also a velar sound but unrelated to <span class="big">ע</span>‎, <span class="big">ع</span> and <span class="big">غ</span>.

				There are cases when the letters <span class="big">ي ,و ,ا</span> and <span class="big">ה ,י ,ו ,א</span> combine with a mark above, below or to the side of the letter before (or the same letter) to signify a vowel sound rather than their usual glottal stop (or silent), <i>w</i> (or <i>v</i>), <i>y</i> and <i>h</i> sounds. This is called <dfn>mater lectionis</dfn> (Western term) or <dfn>madd</dfn> (Arabic).
			</p>
			<p>
				However, when <span class="big">ي</span> and <span class="big">י</span> are silent because of mater lectionis we may still perceive them as a <i>y</i> sound. The vowels being constructed in these cases are things like <i>ay</i> and <i>ey</i>, and the letter <i>y</i> acts in a similar way in English as it does in Arabic and Hebrew. Nonetheless, the <i>y</i> in <i>bay</i> is noticeably different from the <i>y</i> in <i>yam</i>. Many combinations of mater lectionis correspond with English, for example <i>rainb<span class="emchar">ow</span></i> and bl<span class="emchar">ah</span>. Others (particularly Arabic ones) are distinctive however. For example, English doesn't use <i>uw</i> to represent <i>oo</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="big">ا</span> is the only letter in the Arabic alphabet which is only ever used to either indicate a vowel or as a silent support for a hamza, but it's never a consonant letter on its own.

		<figcaption>Some more Judeo-Arabic reuse of Hebrew characters. The remaining Arabic characters are mapped to Hebrew ones trivially.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				One or more dots placed above a Hebrew letter are used to indicate one of two things.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A single dot is used to select the soft version of a Hebrew letter, thus performing the same function as the raphe in Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino (<span class="big" dir="rtl">ת&#x5c4; , <span class="combo">פ‎<span style="position: absolute; top: 0.2em; left: 0.25em;">&#x5c4;</span></span> , כ&#x5c4; , ד&#x5c4; , ג&#x5c4;</span>).
				</li>
				<li>
					Dots are also used to decorate a Hebrew character using the same pattern of dots as is found on the corresponding Arabic character. This applies to <span class="big">ت ,ث, ظ ,ض ف ,غ ,خ ,ذ ,ة</span> and <span class="big">ق</span>, and in the cases of the last two this is purely for aesthetic and culture purposes, since leaving their Hebrew equivalents unembellished introduces no ambiguity (so long as <span class="big">ث</span> is marked). However, this artistic flair does not extend to copying the dots from <span class="big">ن ,ي ,ز ,ب</span> or <span class="big">ش</span>. Thus, for example, the pair <span class="big">ט</span> and <span class="big">ט&#x5c4;</span> pleasingly reflect the relationship between <span class="big">ط</span> and <span class="big">ظ</span>.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Collectively, (1) and (2) also effectively perform the same "select other" function as the geresh. The roles of <span class="big">ג‬</span> and <span class="big">ג‬&#x5c4;</span> are interchanged in some manuscripts. It's tricky to apply the principles consistently here because both <span class="big">ج</span> and <span class="big">غ</span> have a dot (and <span class="big">غ</span> is also a soft sound). Some manuscripts express <span class="big">ج</span> as <span class="big">גִ</span>, although if Hebrew vowel annotations are used then the dot underneath looks the same as the hiriq symbol. The two principles are also in tension with one another when it comes to representing <span class="big">خ</span>, since the more aesthetically pleasing option would be to write it as <span class="big">ח‎</span> with a dot, but this is not done; instead <span class="big">כ</span> is chosen as the basic shape, which is more conventional from a Hebrew centred point of view. Likewise, <span class="big">غ</span> is not represented as <span class="big">ע</span> with a dot.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			The hardening dagesh is often not used. <span class="big">ב</span> represents <i>b</i> and not <i>v</i>, and <span class="big">כ</span> represents <i>k</i> and not <i>k<span class="hebrew">h</span></i>. Sounds are simply hard by default.
		</li>
		<li>
			The diacritic marks used can be Arabic ones, Hebrew ones or (commonly) none at all.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Short vowels can be indicated using either fathah, kasrah and dammah <em>or</em> patach, hiriq and kubutz. Sometimes kasrah is written as <span class="big">י</span> and dammah is written as <span class="big">ו‎</span>, though this makes it ambiguous as to which vowels are short and which are long. This probably reflects a relaxation of the pronunciation rules for short vs. long vowels in the local Arabic dialect (e.g. Egyptian Arabic). Sometimes additional Hebrew vowel marks are recorded, such as tsere (<i>e</i>), again reflecting differences in pronunciation between Standard/Literary Arabic and local dialects.
				</li>
				<li>
					Alif maddah can be indicated either by placing the maddah symbol over an <span class="big">א</span> or by using a kamatz, or just left as plain <span class="big">א</span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					A dagger alif can be represented somehow, though I'm not sure how it's done. (Using dagger alif? Using a superscript <span class="big">א</span>? Or a normal <span class="big">א</span>?)
				</li>
				<li>
					A doubled letter can be indicated using either a shaddah <em>or</em> a strengthening dagesh. Additionally, <span class="big">وّ</span> (when preceded by a dammah) can also be written <span class="big">וו</span> (possibly preceded by dammah or written as a shuruk), mirroring Hebrew writing (where it's impossible for the same dot to represent both shuruk and dagesh).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Some Classical Arabic diacritics are not used in Judeo-Arabic.
			<ul>
				<li>
					The suk<span class="long">u</span>n symbol is not used in Judeo-Arabic, although the shewa symbol can be used instead to indicate the same function.
				</li>
				<li>
					The signs for tanwin are not used in Judeo-Arabic. The kasratan (<i>-in</i>) and dammatan (<i>-un</i>) are simply dropped. The fathatan is represented in late/modern Judeo-Arabic by breaking it down phonetically as <i>-an</i> and using a nun, rather than considering tanwin as its own symbol distinct from nun, as is the case in normal Arabic writing. In early and classical Judeo-Arabic writing fathatan was represented by <span class="big">א</span>. Tanwin is generally primarily a feature of Literary Arabic and is often omitted in everyday language.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hamza al-wasl (silent alif, <span class="big">ٱ</span>) is not marked using a special sign but is instead expressed using a regular <span class="big">א</span>. Sometimes authors overcompensated and added vowel marks to a silent alif/aleph! Another kind of silent alif, which is written in normal Arabic script without any diacritic, <dfn>Alif Taw<span class="long">i</span>la</dfn>, also known as <dfn>Alif Al-F<span class="long">a</span><span class="thick arabic-only">s</span>ila</dfn> or <dfn>Otiose Alif</dfn>, used in the 3rd person masculine plural past tense. This is also rendered faithfully in Judeo-Arabic as <span class="big">א</span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The symbol for hamza al-qat (glottal stop) is not used. Instead, one of two things happens. Either, we have some consonants without any indication of a hamza. These may include a <span class="big">ו‎</span> or a <span class="big">י</span> where the equivalent <span class="big">و</span> or <span class="big">ى</span> in normal Arabic writing would only act as the "support" for the hamza and neither indicate a consonant nor a long vowel. Alternatively, the glottal stop may be written in the Hebrew style using an <span class="big">א</span> regardless of which character would support the hamza in conventional Arabic writing.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a Judeo-Arabic ligature that mirrors the conventional Arabic <span class="big">ﻻ</span> (<i>laa</i>), "Where the upper left edge of the Alef is extended to create the top of a Lamed."
		</li>
		<li>
			Judeo-Arabic works frequently include Hebrew words inside the body of Arabic text, and sometimes these are inflected according to Arabic patterns rather than Hebrew ones.
