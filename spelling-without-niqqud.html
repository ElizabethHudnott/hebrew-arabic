	<h1>Hebrew Spelling Without Niqqud</h1>
	<p>
		Modern Israeli Hebrew is written without vowel marks (niqqud). Unlike Torah scrolls, which also lack vowel marks, Modern Hebrew does have representations for most of the vowels. How's it done? This page will describe the steps required to turn a Hebrew word with niqqud into an equivalent word in Modern Hebrew.

	<h1>Promote Holam Haser to Holam Waw</h1>
	<p>
		In this step, any instances of  <span class="big combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.02em;">&#x5b9;</span></span> without <span class="big">ו</span> or <span class="big">ה</span> are turned into <span class="big">וֺ&#x25cc;</span>. After this stage the word still preserves all of the information about the traditional pronunciation.
	</p>

<section>
	<h1>Promote Hirik Haser, Kubutz and Kamatz Katan</h1>
	<p>
		Since the difference in vowel length between medium and long length vowels no longer exists in everyday Israeli pronunciation, <span class="big combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.55em; left:0.25em">&#x5b4;</span></span> (i) can be promoted to <span class="big">י<span class="combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.55em; left:0.25em">&#x5b4;</span></span></span> (<span class="long">i</span> in liturgical pronunciation) and thus i becomes represented by a full letter <span class="big">י</span> after the niqqud symbols are dropped in the final step.  Likewise, <span class="big combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.25em; left: 0.15em">&#x5bb;</span></span> becomes <span class="big">וּ&#x25cc;</span> and <span class="big combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.4em; left:0.2em">&#x5b8;</span></span> becomes <span class="big">וֺ&#x25cc;</span> (both reduced to a plain <span class="big">ו</span> after the niqqud are removed).
	</p>

<section>
	<h1>Double Consonantal <span class="big">ו</span> and <span class="big">י</span></h1>
	<p>
		If we simply dropped the niqqud symbols at this point then lots of ambiguity would be created. For example, <span class="big">ו</span> could stand for <i>v</i>, <i>u</i> or <i>o</i>. To reduce the ambiguity a bit, when <span class="big">ו</span> stands for <i>v</i> then it's written twice as <span class="big">וו</span> in the modern spelling (an idea borrowed from Yiddish). Similarly, in Modern Hebrew, when <span class="big">י</span> stands for <i>y</i> then it's written as <span class="big">יי</span>, and when it stands for <i>i</i> or <i>e</i> then those are written using a single <span class="big">י</span>.

<section>
	<h1>Delete the Niqqud!</h1>
	<p>
		The vowel marks are removed, as is the silent shewa (lack of vowel) indicator, as are the dots over the <span class="big">שׂ</span> and <span class="big">שׁ</span>, and any dageshes (doubling or strengthening) except where a <span class="big">כּ, בּ</span> or <span class="big">פּ</span> occurs in an unusual place because a word that's been borrowed from English, French, Russian or Yiddish doesn't fit the standard Hebrew model.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>But There Are Exceptions!</h1>
	<p>
		There are some systematic exceptions to the second and third rules. And if one needs to clarify a remaining ambiguity then it's sometimes useful to reinstate the occasional niqqud symbol.
