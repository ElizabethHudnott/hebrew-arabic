<h1>Vowel Markings</h1>
<p>
	Vowels are indicated be a combination of certain consonant letters which alternatively sometimes indicate vowels (<i>mater lectionis</i>) and annotations above or below any consonant letter. An exception is the shuruk, which is only ever placed <em>beside</em> the letter waw (also known as vav). The annotations are collectively called <dfn>niqqud</dfn> in Hebrew and <dfn><span class="thick">h</span>arakat</dfn> in Arabic.
</p>
<p>
	Arabic has three different vowel sounds (<i>a</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, pronounced "ah", "ee" and "oo") and they each come in two different lengths. A medium length vowel is pronounced for one unit of time and a long vowel is pronounced for two units.  One unit of time is the amount of time that it takes to raise one finger.  The fat<span class="thick">h</span>ah, kasrah and <span class="thick">d</span>ammah symbols indicate which vowel sound is pronounced <em>after</em> the consonant letter they are placed over or underneath. When an additional symbol, the <dfn>suk<span class="long">u</span>n</dfn>, is placed above a consonant it means there is no vowel sound between that consonant and the next one. Another kind of mark called a <dfn>tanwin</dfn> is pronounced as a short vowel followed by an "n" sound.
</p>
<p>
	Hebrew vowels are indicated using an annotation system called <dfn>Tiberian Vocalization</dfn>. The consonants are part of the Biblical text but the niqqud annotations were invented by the Jewish scholarly community located at Tiberias in Galilee around 750CE. In attempting to record and preserve the ancient way the Bible was spoken they identified seven different vowel sounds which came in three different lengths.
</p>
<p>
	There were two previous attempts to record Hebrew vowel sounds in the 6th and 7th centuries, <em>Babylonian Vocalization</em> and <em>Palestinian Vocalization</em> (from Jerusalem). The manuscripts which used the Tiberian classification system became the authoritative versions although no modern community pronounces the symbols in exactly the same way as described by the Tiberian scholars. Everyone now reads using the Tiberian system (although Modern Israeli Hebrew writing minimizes the usage of vowel annotations altogether) but nonetheless the pronunciations used by Sephardic Jews share their origins with the ancient community in Jerusalem who studied and recorded their pronunciation in the now disused Palestinian annotation system. And the pronunciations of Yemenite Jews lie behind the Babylonian Vocalization. Why is this important? The Palestinian and Babylonian systems recorded fewer vowel categories than the Tiberian system. Consequently, some of the Tiberian symbols are pronounced the same as each other in Sephardic and Yemeni Hebrew. What the Tiberian scholars recorded as separate vowels others considered as merely different accents of the same vowel. The origins of Ashkenazi pronunciation are less clear but may originate from Tiberian pronunciation (or Babylonian).
</p>
<p>
	I will present three things here. Firstly, we'll look briefly at vowel sounds in English. Then I'll describe the Tiberian annotation system and what is believed to be the original pronunciations of the people of Galilee upon which it is based. Since the Tiberian accent is no longer spoken by any Jewish community I'll describe how to read off the Sephardic pronunciation from the annotations originally designed for recording Tiberian. Finally, I'll mention some of the spelling variations that arise when Hebrew is transcribed into English characters because of differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazi pronunciation.

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p class="footnotes">
		In Sephardic pronunciation, tsere and segol are both pronounced as [e:] and [e] respectively (same sound but different lengths) and kamatz katan is pronounced as [o], which is a shorter version of the holam [o:]. Katan means "small" and the vowel is "smaller" than the long vowels by being shorter.

		<li>
			When transcribing with intent to preserve the Tiberian pronunciation (rather than the Sephardic) the long versions of these are transcribed as <span class="emchar">ẹ</span> and <span class="emchar">ọ</span> respectively, since <span class="long">e</span> and <span class="long">o</span> are already used for the tsere and holam.

					An extra short vowel. This also comes in two forms.
					<ol>
						<li>
							Where the two dots appear on their own, without any explicit indication of which particular vowel sound is to be spoken for an extra short amount of time, called a <dfn>vocal sh'vā</dfn> (which looks visually identical to the silent sh'vā).

				<figcaption>Traditional rules for pronouncing vocal sh'vā, mostly now reduced to ĕ in all cases.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</li>
		<li>
			These are described as "short" in some contexts and grouped together with the "long" vowels in others.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>In the Tiberian system the patterns on this row can represent both medium and long length vowels. With the exception of tsere and holam (which were always long) these patterns historically represented long vowels in open syllables (<span class="syllable-structure">CVV</span>) and medium length vowels in closed syllables (<span class="syllable-structure">CVC</span>), the lengthened vowel "filling in" for the "missing" consonant. The distinction was largely allophonic, meaning there were rarely any words which differed only in respect of one of these symbols being pronounced as medium length in one word and long in the other. Outside of the Tiberian tradition the vowel length for the patterns on this row is fixed as being either always medium or always long, with one exception. Going one step further, the realization of "medium" and "long" vowels as two different lengths of sound is now considered completely irrelevant in Modern Israeli Hebrew. Nonetheless, the Tiberian tradition is thought to have once implemented this feature systematically depending on whether or not there followed a <span class="big">ה ,ו ,י</span> or <span class="big">א</span>, in a similar way to how Arabic uses <span class="big">وْ ,يْ</span> and <span class="big" style="vertical-align: sub;">اْ</span>. The possible syllable structures and terminology (such as <span class="syllable-structure">CVV</span> versus <span class="syllable-structure">CVC</span>) will be explored fully in <a href="#s-syllables" class="xref"></a>.</p>

			<p>Instead of the open versus closed syllable distinction, medieval Sephardic pronunciation (from which Modern Hebrew is ultimately descended) largely differentiated between medium and long length vowels based on the vowel symbol itself rather than the presence or absence of a mater lectionis letter afterwards. Tsere and holam are always long in this tradition (as in Tiberian). Segol is medium length irrespective of whether it's followed by a <span class="big">י</span>. Patach and kubutz are also always medium length because the open/closed syllable distinction now only applies to kamatz. Kamatz is medium or long, depending on whether the syllable is open or closed (as in Tiberian, but for Sephardic Jews it also changes from an <i>o</i> sound to an <i>a</i> sound. <em>It's also pronounced as long-<i>a</i> in stressed syllables, which are usually the last syllables of each word although other syllables can be noted as stressed by adding a meteg or an accent mark (<dfn>ole</dfn>), <span class="big combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.6em">&#x5ab;</span></span>, but it's never an <i>a</i> sound if the next letter has a hataf kamatz</em>). Hiriq is either medium or long, but dependent only on whether there is <span class="big">י</span> after it and the open&nbsp;vs. closed syllable distinction is irrelevant. Shuruk is long (as always). The difference in length between segol and tsere exists despite the fact that early examples of Palestinian notation used only one symbol in the places where Tiberian had either segol or tsere, suggesting that perhaps the difference in length is a later development. Later examples of Palestinian notation did use two separate symbols.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="big">א</span> can also occur instead of <span class="big">ה</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			These are usually described as "short", since Arabic doesn't have anything shorter.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="big">آ</span> represents the glottal stop&ndash;<i>a</i>&nbsp;vowel combination that could theoretically be represented by the combination <span class="big">أَاْ</span> but isn't in practice.
		</li>
		<li>
			Tanwin is pronounced as a medium length vowel sound followed by an <i>n</i> sound.
		</li>
		<li>
			When patach appears underneath the last letter of a word and the last letter is <span class="big">ח ,הּ</span> or <span class="big">ע</span> (i.e. the gutterals except for <span class="big">א</span>) then the vowel is pronounced <em>before</em> the consonant. This phenomenon is called <dfn>Stolen Patach</dfn>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In transcriptions the long vowels can be differentiated from medium length vowels in various different ways.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Long vowels may be represented using a line above: <span class="long">a</span>, <span class="long">e</span>, <span class="long">i</span>, <span class="long">o</span>, <span class="long">u</span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Long vowels can also be represented using an acute accent: á, é, í, ó, ú.
				</li>
				<li>
					Two-letter combinations can be used to represent long vowels (and sometimes there is a choice between two different two-letter combinations, see <a href="#fig-two-letter" class="xref"></a>).  However, all two-letter combinations apart from <i>ah</i>, <i>ei&nbsp;/ ey</i> and <i>éi&nbsp;/ éy</i> are for informal educational use and internet chat only.
				</li>
				<li>
					Long vowels are sometimes left undifferentiated from medium and extra short vowels: a, e, i, o, u. However this loses information about the both correct pronunciation and the spelling of the original Arabic or pre-modern Hebrew.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sometimes tsere and segol are differentiated using <i>é</i> and <i>e</i> but the other vowel pairs are left undifferentiated.

	<h2>"Diphthongs"</h2>
	<p>
		What is a diphthong? A simple definition is that it's when two vowel sounds occur next to each other. That's a good start, but it's insufficient.  Consider the word <i>ten<span class="emchar">uou</span>s</i>. There's two vowel sounds next to each other there, but the published analytical descriptions of English don't list this pair as a diphthong.  Whereas the sound in <i>b<span class="emchar">eer</span></i> is considered a diphthong. The <i class="emchar">u</i> and the <i class="emchar">ou</i> can clearly be heard as two separate vowels whereas the <i class="emchar">eer</i> is more of a smooth "swinging" motion. So, English has a lot of diphthongs but not every pair of English vowels is a diphthong. There are two further complications to consider.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The sounds represented by the English letters <i>w</i> and <i>y</i> sometimes sound like vowels and sometimes sound like consonants. Consider the pairs <i>b<span class="emchar">ow</span></i> and <i><span class="emchar">w</span>et</i>, and, <i>b<span class="emchar">ay</span></i> and <i><span class="emchar">y</span>et</i>. It turns out this isn't a freakish English spelling thing but a general phenomenon that's common to many languages. These sounds are called <dfn>semivowels</dfn>.
		</li>
		<li>
			According to some definitions of the word diphthong, a pair of sounds is only referred to as a diphthong in cases where two vowels (or a vowel and a semivowel) can take the place where normally (according to the rules for constructing syllables in the given language) <strong>a single vowel would be expected.</strong> However, this situation never occurs in Hebrew or Arabic. We only have cases where a vowel and semivowel (i.e. a special kind of consonant) are written where <strong>a vowel and a consonant are expected.</strong> This is why many Arab scholars state that Arabic doesn't have any diphthongs, because according to this narrow definition it doesn't!  Nonetheless, the sounds involved are distinctive and they do sound similar to genuine diphthongs that we're familiar with in English.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are three levels of formality when it comes to transcribing the diphthongs into English letters.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The most formal method (primarily used in education and academia) is to transcribe the first vowel "as normal" (including the macron above it if it's a long vowel), and to transcribe the Yod&nbsp;/ Y<span class="long">a</span> as <i>y</i>, also as normal.
		</li>
		<li>
			A more informal approach is transcribe the vowel without attempting to distinguish between long and medium length vowels, and to transcribe the Yod&nbsp;/Y<span class="long">a</span> as <i>y</i>, as normal.
		</li>
		<li>
			The difference between the first two methods also can be applied to transcribing Arabic and Hebrew vowels more generally. Additionally, for Hebrew diphthongs in particular, a third scheme is to transcribe the Yod as <i>i</i> when it's part of a diphthong.
		</li>

			Formed by a tendency to soften the <i>y</i> sound when it occurs between an <i>a</i> and an <i>i</i>. May sound more like <i>a-yi</i> in other speakers or accents.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <span class="big">ي</span> can also be with shaddah (<span class="big">يّ</span>) instead of with sukoon (<span class="big">يْ</span>), in which case the transcription would be <i>ayy</i>. Similarly, in each case in this table the Yod (<span class="big">י</span>) could have a doubling dagesh inside it (and any vowel mark underneath) instead of a silent sh'vā (see the <span class="long">a</span>yy case for an example fragment).
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Diphthongs created using the <i>w</i> semivowel are rarer in Hebrew than they are in Arabic. An <i>aw</i> diphthong in many Arabic words tends to morph into an <span class="long">o</span> vowel in the equivalent Hebrew word, although <dfn>orthographically</dfn> (meaning in written form) this difference is small because the holam is often written above a <i>waw</i>, the <i>holam-waw</i>, <span class="big">וֹ</span>. Deriving the correct pronunciations for <i>w</i> diphthongs (where they do exist) requires two considerations.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			In the most common contemporary Hebrew accents (both in liturgy and common speech), <span class="big">ו</span> overwhelmingly represents a <i>v</i> sound rather than <i>w</i> sound. Since <i>v</i> is not a semivowel then combinations like <i>av</i>, <i>iv</i> and <i>ov</i> are in no way diphthongs according to any sensible definition of the term, and these combinations end up being listed in this section solely because of accidents of history.
		</li>
		<li>
			The pronunciation of kamatz gadol varies between different Hebrew accents. It's either an <i>a</i>-type vowel or an <i>o</i>-type vowel.

			This is an example of a rare phenomenon called <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qere_and_Ketiv">Qere and Ketiv</a></dfn>, a difference between what is written in the Bible and what has always traditionally been read aloud in synagogue (literally Aramaic for "read" and "written"). In this way the text has a dual meaning.  <span class="big">ו<span class="combo">&#x25cc;<span class="over" style="width:0.55em">&#x5b4;</span></span></span> is an illegal combination in Hebrew so we can deduce that two words are present. Take, for example, the form <span class="big">הִוא</span>. One word is expressed by the written consonants <span class="big">הוא</span> (the 3rd person masculine singular pronoun), while the vowel marks imply that the word to be read aloud is <span class="big">הִיא</span>, which is the 3rd person <em>feminine</em> singular pronoun.  Another example is the consonants <span class="big">יהוה</span>, which are annotated using vowels taken from the word <span class="big">אֲדֹנָי</span>, because Jews are forbidden from reciting God's name aloud so the vowel marks remind them to pronounce <i>Ad<span class="long">o</span>n<span class="long">a</span>i</i> instead. There is no such word in Hebrew as Yehovah or Jehovah. The form <span class="big">יְהוָה</span> is an example of qere and ketiv being used to encode the two words <span class="big">יהוה</span> and <span class="big">אֲדֹנָי</span> simultaneously. The <i>J</i> in Jehovah arises because the letter <i>j</i> in the German alphabet represents the same sound as an English <i>y</i> and Germany was an important place for early Protestant Biblical scholarship.

<section id="s-syllables">
	<h1>Syllable Structures</h1>
	<h2>Simple Rules</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			There are two kinds of syllables.
			<ul>
				<li><em>Open syllables</em> with a <em>Consonant&ndash;Vowel</em> pattern.</li>
				<li><em>Closed syllables</em> with a <em>Consonant&ndash;Vowel&ndash;Consonant</em> pattern.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Thus, when reading, one has to distinguish three things.
			<ol>
				<li>The first consonant.</li>
				<li>The vowel<br/>(which might be indicated by a symbol beside the first consonant only.  This is usually but not always underneath in Hebrew, above or below in Arabic. Or the vowel might be indicated using a combination of a symbol and a mater lectionis letter following onward towards the left hand side of the page).</li>
				<li>Whether or not the next letter forms part of the current syllable or belongs as the first consonant of the next syllable.
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			If the vowel is a sh'vā or a hataf vowel then the syllable is an open one and the next letter doesn't need to be inspected yet.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the second letter is marked with one these two annotations then the second letter forms part of the current syllable:
			<ul>
				<li>A sukun (<span class="big">◌ْ</span>), or, equivalently a silent sh'vā.</li>
				<li>A shaddah (<span class="big">◌ّ</span>), or, equivalently a dagesh (which will be a doubling dagesh).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In most of these cases in Arabic the syllable is a closed syllable.  In the cases of <span class="big">يْ</span> preceded by <span class="big">◌ِ</span> and <span class="big">وْ</span> preceded by <span class="big">◌ُ</span> the syllable is an open syllable with a long vowel sound but the second letter is nonetheless still the last letter of the current syllable.  See the discussion about super heavy syllables in <a href="#ss-full-syllable-rules" class="xref"></a> for a few tricky cases.
			</p>
			<p>In Hebrew the syllable is definitely a closed syllable when there's a dagesh and is usually a closed syllable when there's a sh'vā, although sometimes the sh'vā can be vocal sh'vā and belong to the next syllable instead.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			If the second letter has a vowel sign of its own and doesn't have a shaddah or a dagesh then the second letter plays no part in the current syllable.
		</li>
		<li>
			In Hebrew, if a letter doesn't have its own vowel marking and it doesn't have a silent sh'vā or a mappiq then it's a mater lectionis letter.  That is, it will be one of <span class="big">ו , ה, א</span> or <span class="big">י</span> and it will be occurring in it's capacity as a vowel rather than these letters' other capacities as consonants. Only <span class="big">ה</span> and <span class="big">א</span> can have a mappiq, which looks like a dagesh (these two letters cannot have a dagesh).
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="ss-full-syllable-rules">Full Rules</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The possible ways of forming syllables in a language can be described using patterns of <span class="syllable-structure">C</span>s and <span class="syllable-structure">V</span>s, where <span class="syllable-structure">C</span> stands for any consonant and <span class="syllable-structure">V</span> stands for any vowel.
		</li>
		<li>
			English syllables are summarized by the structure <span class="syllable-structure">(CCC)V(CCCC)</span>, where one or more of the letters in brackets do not always occur in every syllable and the vowel in this case can be short, long or a diphthong. Thus, the word <i>strengths</i> (/strɛŋkθs/ in IPA) fits this pattern with all of the optional consonant slots filled, and therefore (because all of the sounds have been matched) the whole word is one syllable.  Fortunately, Hebrew and Arabic have simpler syllable structures.
		</li>
		<li>
			I'll use the convention (not used unanimously by all authors) that <span class="syllable-structure">VV</span> stands for a long vowel.
		</li>
		<li>
			A shaddah or a doubling dagesh signals two identical consonants (<span class="syllable-structure">CC</span>) (which sometimes belong to separate syllables).
		</li>
		<li>
			Syllables can be classified into 3 categories based on how many <span class="syllable-structure">V</span>s and <span class="syllable-structure">C</span>s they have. Each syllable is either light (1&ndash;2), heavy (3) or super heavy (4 or more).
		</li>
		<li>
			Some fudges are commonly used to keep things simple.
			<ul>
				<li>
					A diphthong counts as a vowel and consonant (<span class="syllable-structure">VC</span> or <span class="syllable-structure">VVC</span>) for the purpose of identifying syllables.
				</li>
				<li>
					Stolen Patach isn't counted at all.
				</li>
				<li>
					Analytically, it is simplest to consider vocal sh'vā (ĕ) as a vowel that forms part of an open syllable (<span class="syllable-structure">CV</span>). In terms of pronunciation however, a sh'vā is a brief burst of sound, shorter than a normal vowel, and it makes sense to think of the sh'vā and the preceeding consonant as attached to the syllable that follows it so as to not accidentally lengthen the sh'vā.  This difficulty causes some authors to use a different classification system that includes additional terms such as "doubly closed syllable" or "virtually closed syllable".
					<ul>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			An English speaker won't be able to identify the glottal stop sound produced at the beginning of words beginning with alif <span class="big">(ا&nbsp;/ א)</span>.  It is actually a consonant sound.  However, all English words which are written with an initial vowel are actually pronounced by English speakers as a glottal stop followed by the vowel, we just don't notice it.  An English speaker may be tempted to describe a word like <i>app</i> as having a <span class="syllable-structure">VC</span> syllable structure even though the structure is really <span class="syllable-structure">CVC</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			According to the Tiberian pronunciation rules all <span class="syllable-structure">CV</span> syllables have either a vocal sh'vā or a hataf vowel.
		</li>
		<li>
			All hataf vowels belong to open syllables (<span class="syllable-structure">CV</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			Super heavy syllables only occur in Arabic in two specific circumstances.
			<ol>
				<li>
					In uses of a word outside of the context of a sentence (such as a dictionary-style definition), where it is written without a short vowel or a tanwin present on the last letter. Final vowels and tanwin perform grammatical functions, so when seen within the context of a word in a sentence of Classical Arabic writing these words would have one of these endings attached (<i>-a</i>, <i>-i</i>, <i>-u</i>, <i>-an</i>, <i>-in</i> or <i>-un</i>). However, when speaking and pausing for breath after the word, coming to the end of sentence, or finishing recitation these word endings are dropped (called <dfn>pausal pronunciation</dfn>), and this will cause a super heavy syllable to form in spoken word.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the long vowel <i class="long">a</i> occurs before a letter with a shaddah (<span class="big">◌ّاْ◌َ</span>).
					<ol>
						<li>
							If the letter with shaddah is the last letter of the word then a <span class="syllable-structure">CVVCC</span> syllable can occur (if there's no final short vowel).
						</li>
						<li>
							If it's not the last letter then a <span class="syllable-structure">CVVC</span> syllable occurs and the third consonant (implied by the shaddah) forms the beginning of the next syllable.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Words are most reliably broken into syllables by starting from the end of each word and working backwards, matching letters and vowel signs to the patterns in <a href="#fig-syllables" class="xref"></a> as you go. However, starting from the beginning of a word and reading forwards usually works too.

	<h1>Sh'vā: Silent or Vocal?</h1>
	<p>
		The same symbol is used to indicate both the silent sh'vā and the vocal sh'vā. How do we know when a sh'vā is vocal (a short vowel sound) or silent (no sound)? The purpose of a silent sh'vā is to indicate closed syllables. Thus, where we're expecting the possibility of a closed syllable the sh'vā is silent and if we're not expecting to read the end of a closed syllable then the sh'vā is vocal.
