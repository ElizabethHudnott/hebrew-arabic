<h1>Vowels</h1>
<p>
	Vowels are indicated be a combination of certain consonant letters which alternatively sometimes indicate vowels (<i>mater lectionis</i>) and annotations above or below any consonant letter. An exception is the shuruk, which is only ever placed beside the letter waw. The annotations are named <dfn>niqqud</dfn> in Hebrew and <dfn>harakat</dfn> in Arabic.
</p>
<p>Vowels are described in terms of four different aspects.</p>

<p>
	Arabic has three different vowel sounds (<i>a</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, pronounced "ah", "ee" and "oo") and they each come in two different lengths. The fat<span class="arabic-only thick">h</span>ah, kasrah and <span class="arabic-only thick">D</span>ammah symbols indicate which vowel sound is pronounced <em>after</em> the consonant letter they are placed over or under. When an additional symbol, the <dfn>suk<span class="long">u</span>n</dfn>, is placed above a consonant it means there is no vowel sound between that consonant and the next one. A <dfn>tanwin</dfn> is pronounced as a short vowel followed by an "n" sound.
</p>
<p>
	Hebrew vowels are indicated using an annotation system called <dfn>Tiberian Vocalization</dfn>. The consonants are part of the Biblical text but the niqqud annotations were invented by the Jewish scholarly community located at Tiberias in Galilee around 750CE. In attempting to record and preserve the ancient way that the Bible was spoken they identified seven different vowel sounds which came in three different lengths.
</p>
<p>
	There were two prior attempts to record the vowel sounds in the 6th and 7th centuries, <em>Babylonian Vocalization</em> and <em>Palestinian Vocalization</em> (from Jerusalem). The manuscripts which used the Tiberian classification system became the authoritative versions although no modern community pronounces the symbols in exactly the same way as described by the Tiberian scholars. Everyone now reads using the Tiberian system (although Modern Israeli Hebrew writing minimizes the usage of vowel annotations altogether) but nonetheless the pronunciations used by Sephardic Jews share their origins with the ancient community in Jerusalem who studied and recorded their pronunciation in the now disused Palestinian annotation system. And the pronunciations of Yemenite Jews lie behind the Babylonian Vocalization. Why is this important? The Palestinian and Babylonian systems recorded fewer vowel categories than the Tiberian system. Consequently, some of the Tiberian symbols are pronounced the same as each other in Sephardic and Yemeni Hebrew. What the Tiberian scholars recorded as separate vowels others considered as merely different regional accents of the same vowel. The origins of Ashkenazi pronunciation are less clear but may originate from Tiberian pronunciation (or Babylonian).
</p>
<p>
	I will present three things here. Firstly, we'll look briefly at vowel sounds in English. Then I'll describe the Tiberian annotation system and what is believed to be the original pronunciations of the people of Galilee upon which it is based. Since Tiberian is a dead dialect I'll describe how to read off the Sephardic pronunciation from the annotations originally designed for recording Tiberian. Finally, I'll mention some of the spelling variations that arise when Hebrew is transcribed into English characters because of differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazi pronunciation.

	<h2>Footnotes</h2>
	<p class="footnotes">
		In Sephardic pronunciation, tsere and segol are both pronounced as [e] (or [e:]) and kamatz katan is pronounced as [o], a shorter version of the holam [o:]. Katan means "small" and the vowel is "smaller" than the long vowels by being shorter.
	</p>
	<ol class="footnotes">
		<li>
			The long versions of these are transcribed as <span class="emchar">ẹ</span> and <span class="emchar">ọ</span> (or <span class="long">a</span>) respectively, since <span class="long">e</span> and <span class="long">o</span> are already used for the tsere and holam. <span class="long">a</span> reflects the Sephardic pronunciation of kamatz gadol  ("big") as an <i>a</i> sound.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Two vertical dots are used to indicate two things in the Tiberian system.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Silence, the absence of a vowel between two consonants, called a <dfn>silent shewa</dfn>.
					</p>

					<p>
						English also has cases where two consonants run together, for example <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> as <i>st</i>; <i>t</i> and <i>r</i> as <i>tr</i>, etc. but we don't have a special "no vowel" character, there just isn't a vowel letter written after the first consonant.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					An extra short vowel. This also comes in two forms.
					<ol>
						<li>
							Where the two dots appear on their own, without any explicit indication of which particular vowel sound is to be spoken for an extra short amount of time, called a <dfn>mobile shewa</dfn> (which looks visually identical to the silent shewa).
						</li>
						<li>
							Where the two dots appear alongside another vowel symbol, indicating an extra short vowel where the specific vowel sound is marked, known as a <dfn>hataf vowel</dfn>.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				I will defer discussion until a later section concerning the rules on how to identify a silent shewa and how to identify a mobile shewa.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Palestinian and Babylonian notations didn't have any special symbols to distinguish the hataf vowels. In the surviving vocal traditions they've each been promoted to the corresponding medium length vowel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pronunciation of mobile shewa in Tiberian Hebrew follows the rules in <a href="#fig-mobile-shewa" class="xref"></a>. These rules are seldom followed anymore, though the Yemenite Jews and Sephardim from Amsterdam are known for them.

				<figcaption>Traditional rules for pronouncing mobile shewa, mostly now reduced to ĕ in all cases.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</li>
		<li>
			These are described as "short" in some contexts and grouped together with the "Long" vowels in others. In Arabic and Tiberian Hebrew a medium length vowel is pronounced for one unit of time and a long vowel is pronounced for two units.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>In the Tiberian system the patterns on this row can represent both medium and long length vowels. With the exception of tsere and holam (which historically were always long), these patterns historically represented long vowels in open syllables (CV) and medium length vowels in closed syllables (CVC), the lengthened vowel "filling in" for the "missing" consonant. The distinction was largely allophonic, meaning there were rarely any words which differed only in respect of one of these symbols being pronounced as medium length in one word and long in the other. Outside of the Tiberian tradition the vowel length for the patterns on this row only varies between open and closed syllables in the case of kamatz and is fixed as being either always medium or always long otherwise. Furthermore, the realization of "medium" and "long" vowels as two different lengths of sound depending on whether there follows a <span class="big">ה ,ו ,י</span> or <span class="big">א</span> is now considered irrelevant in Modern Israeli Hebrew even though the Tiberian tradition is thought to have once implemented this feature systematically in the same way that Arabic does.</p>

			<p>Instead, medieval Sephardic pronunciation (from which Modern Hebrew is ultimately descended) largely differentiated between medium and long length vowels based on the vowel symbol itself rather than the presence or absence of a mater lectionis letter afterwards. Tsere and holam are always long in this tradition (as in Tiberian). Segol is medium length irrespective of whether it's followed by a <span class="big">י</span>. Kubutz and patach (except when followed by <span class="big">ה</span> or <span class="big">א</span>) are also always medium length because the open/closed syllable distinction now only applies to kamatz. Kamatz is medium or long, depending on whether the syllable is open or closed (as in Tiberian, but for Sephardic Jews it also changes from an <i>o</i> sound to an <i>a</i> sound). Hiriq is either medium or long, but dependent only on whether there is <span class="big">י</span> after it, and open&nbsp;vs. closed syllable is irrelevant. Shuruk is long (as always). The difference in length between segol and tsere exists despite the fact that early examples of Palestinian notation used only one symbol in the places where Tiberian had either segol or tsere, suggesting that perhaps the difference in length is a later development. (Later examples of Palestinian notation did use two separate symbols.)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="big">א</span> can also occur instead of <span class="big">ה</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			These are usually described as "short", since Arabic doesn't have anything shorter.
		</li>
		<li>
			Tanwin is pronounced as a medium length vowel sound followed by an <i>n</i> sound.
		</li>
